## Motivation & Literature Review

Previous research has shown that AR can significantly aid in improving communication and academic skills in children with autism. Recent studies have demonstrated AR's effectiveness in enhancing mathematics skills, vocabulary acquisition in science, and reading comprehension. This project builds on these findings to develop an AR tool specifically designed to improve reading skills in children with autism.

## Methodology

The development of this AR prototype follows the Linear Sequential Model, ensuring a structured and systematic approach. The process is divided into several key stages:

### A. Communication

- **Data Gathering**: Collaboration with educators to understand the educational challenges faced by children with autism.
- **Literature Review**: Analysis of existing research to define software features and functionalities.
- **Instructional Principles**: Focus on structured, incremental learning and reinforcement of positive behavior.

### B. Modeling

- **Use Case Diagram**: Represents the software's functionalities, including selecting reading levels, scanning markers, and interacting with AR content.
- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**: Illustrates data movement within the application, including interaction with AR markers and content display.

### C. Deployment

- **Testing**: Media specialists evaluate the application to ensure it meets standards and identify areas for improvement.
- **User Testing**: The AR application is tested with autistic students to assess its effectiveness in improving reading skills.

## Results and Discussion

The AR application was tested with two autistic students, showing improvements in reading outcomes despite some challenges with letter recognition. The feedback highlighted the application's positive impact on personalized learning, although suggestions were made for enhancing word exploration and incorporating simple sentence reading.

## Conclusion

The AR prototype effectively supports reading skill development in children with autism by offering interactive and engaging features. Future work will involve incorporating practice questions, simplifying instructions, and integrating reading skills with other subjects to enhance learning experiences.
